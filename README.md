# CGE

## Plans for this engine

This is a personal rendering engine for learning purposes.<br><br>
Learning from some cool open source projects:<br>
**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**: https://github.com/o3de/o3de<br>
**Diligent Engine**: https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine<br>
**3dgep's ForwardPlus**: https://github.com/3dgep/ForwardPlus<br>
**Wicked Engine**: https://github.com/turanszkij/WickedEngine<br>

Rasterizer<br>
Data Driven Shader Permutations<br>
Data Driven Material Shaders)<br>
Bindless Resources<br>
Data Driven Frame Graph)<br>
Async Compute and Copy Engine<br>
DXR (Ray Tracing and then Path Tracing)<br>
Instancing - Mesh Shaders - GPU Driven Stuff<br>
Multi-Threaded Command Recording<br>

**Important Note**: This is currently a broken peace of software with lots of stuff going wrong in it, which we try to add to and improve upon daily.
Once Features get completed and fully functional I'll update this page.
