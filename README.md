## Plans for this engine

This is a personal rendering engine for learning purposes.<br><br>
Learning from some cool open source projects:<br>
**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**: https://github.com/o3de/o3de<br>
**Diligent Engine**: https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine<br>
**3dgep's ForwardPlus**: https://github.com/3dgep/ForwardPlus<br>
**Wicked Engine**: https://github.com/turanszkij/WickedEngine<br>

Rasterizer (Working)<br>
Data Driven Shader Permutations (Working)<br>
Data Driven Material Shaders (Working)<br>
Bindless Resources (In Progress)<br>
Data Driven Frame Graph (In Progress)<br>
Async Compute and Copy Engine (In Progress)<br>
DXR (Ray Tracing and then Path Tracing)<br>
Instancing - Mesh Shaders - GPU Driven Stuff<br>
Multi-Threaded Command Recording<br>
